# Mission Tracker

Mission Tracker is a tool to help video game players and developers get the honest reviews they deserve. Although professional reviews play a significant role in determining the success or failure of a game, reviewers often play only a small portion before delivering a verdict, giving consumers poor information and developers misrepresentative reviews. Mission Tracker shines light on this deception, publicly recording the progress of reviewers to encourage more complete playthroughs and improve consumer decisions.
